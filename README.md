- [EAS CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/) (`npm install -g eas-cli`)  
- Android/iOS device or simulator/emulator
- Expo Go for development mode

## üöÄ Run the Project
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**
Set up your API keys in `.env` file in root of project.

Example:
```EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.coinlore.net/api```

You can run the app on:
